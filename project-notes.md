ambient light events have been disabled by even firefox, but not microsoft edge. firefox disabled it because no one was using it (telemtry data) you now have to manually enable it, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1462308 
by creating the proxican demo they will have to change that, possibly other browsers will add support. Need to contact firefox after.
